# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
## Problem Statement
Credit card fraud has surged due to the rise in digital transactions, posing severe financial risks. Traditional fraud detection methods struggle with evolving fraud patterns and high false-positive rates. This project leverages machine learning algorithms and SMOTE to enhance fraud detection accuracy. The goal is to develop a real-time, scalable system that efficiently identifies fraudulent transactions while minimizing false alarms.
